`Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en>`__ is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 
It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

Key features of **Node.js** include:

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop model, allowing it to handle concurrent operations efficiently without the overhead of thread context switching.
- **NPM** (Node Package Manager): A vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools, facilitating rapid development and code reuse.
- **Built-in modules**: Provides core modules for file system operations, networking, cryptography, and more, without requiring external dependencies.
- **Cross-platform** compatibility: Runs on various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Scalability**: Well-suited for microservices architecture and can be easily scaled horizontally.
- **Stream API**: Allows processing of data in chunks, making it ideal for tasks like file I/O and network communications.
- **Child Processes**: Supports spawning child processes, enabling CPU-intensive tasks to be offloaded.
- **Cluster module**: Facilitates load balancing across multiple CPU cores.

Node.js is particularly effective for building scalable network applications, RESTful APIs, real-time applications (e.g., chat systems, gaming servers), and data streaming applications. 
It's widely used in enterprise environments and powers many high-traffic websites.
