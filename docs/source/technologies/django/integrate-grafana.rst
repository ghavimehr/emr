With `Django <./index.html>`__, you can integrate Grafana, a powerful tool to aggregate logs and view these logs on the dashboard. Today, we will learn how to integrate Grafana with Django.

.. include::  /_templates/components/banner-top.rst

Project Setup
-------------

For this project, download the code base at this branch respectfully.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone -b base --single-branch https://github.com/app-generator/docs-django-grafana.git
   cd  docs-django-grafana

After that, install the dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

You can now run migrations and start the project.

.. code-block:: bash

   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver

The project will be running at http://localhost:8000.


Create Transaction App
----------------------

We will add an application and dummy data to monitor the data better. At the root of the project, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   python manage.py startapp transactions

This will create a new Python package called ``transactions`` with files such as ``models.py`` and ``views.py`` that we will modify. But before that, make sure the newly created application is registered in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in the ``settings.py`` file of the project.

.. code-block:: python

   # core/settings.py

   INSTALLED_APPS = [

      ...
   
      # APPS
      "home",
      "transactions",
      # Util
      "debug_toolbar",
      "rest_framework"
   ]

After that, we can add the Transaction model. In the ``transactions/models.py`` file, add the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   # transactions/models.py

   from django.db import models
   from django.utils import timezone

   class Transaction(models.Model):
       user_id = models.IntegerField()
       amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
       transaction_type = models.CharField(max_length=10)
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)

       def __str__(self):
           return f"Transaction: {self.user_id} - {self.amount} ({self.transaction_type})"

Then, we can add the ``TransactionSerializer``. In the ``transactions/serializers.py`` file, add the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   # transactions/serializers.py

   from rest_framework import serializers
   from .models import Transaction

   class TransactionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = Transaction
           fields = ["id", "user_id", "amount", "transaction_type", "timestamp"]

With the serializer added, we can now add a DRF view to expose the transaction data.

.. code-block:: python

   # transactions/views.py
   from rest_framework import generics
   from .models import Transaction
   from .serializers import TransactionSerializer

   class TransactionListView(generics.ListAPIView):
       queryset = Transaction.objects.all()
       serializer_class = TransactionSerializer

With this done, we can register this view so we can access it from our Django application. In the ``home/urls.py`` add the following lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   from django.urls import path
   from . import views
   from transactions.views import TransactionListView as transactions

   urlpatterns = [
       path("", views.index, name="index"),
       path("transactions/", transactions.as_view(), name="transaction-list"),
   ]

After that, run the migrations to create a new table in the database that we will fill with data. Run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate

These commands will create a table in the DB and commit these changes to the database. After that, add this Python script to the ``transactions`` directory.

.. code-block:: python

   import random
   from decimal import Decimal
   from .models import Transaction

   def create_dummy_transactions(num_records=20000):
       transaction_types = ["credit", "debit"]

       for _ in range(num_records):
           user_id = random.randint(1, 100)
           amount = Decimal(random.uniform(1.00, 1000.00)).quantize(Decimal("0.01"))
           transaction_type = random.choice(transaction_types)

           Transaction.objects.create(
               user_id=user_id, amount=amount, transaction_type=transaction_type
           )

       print(f"{num_records} dummy transactions added to the database.")

We will run this function to insert 20000 transaction entries in the database. This will be used for testing with Grafana. Open the Python shell and type the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

   >>> from transactions.dummy_data import create_dummy_transactions
   >>> create_dummy_transactions()
   20000 dummy transactions added to the database.

With the data added now, we can move to add an endpoint that will expose logs regarding SQL queries made and their time.


Exposing Db Logs
----------------

In some scenarios, you may want to expose the logs of database queries directly from a file for easier monitoring and visualization. 
This can be useful when monitoring query performance, detecting slow queries, or analyzing query patterns over time. 
In this section, we`ll walk through how to capture SQL query logs in a file, expose these logs via an API, and make them accessible for monitoring using tools like Grafana or other log analysis platforms.


Enable SQL Query Logging in Django
----------------------------------

Django provides built-in logging capabilities that allow you to track SQL queries executed by your application. 
By configuring Django`s logging system, you can output SQL queries to a log file. This file can later be exposed via an API for external monitoring.

In your ``settings.py``, configure logging to capture database queries:

.. code-block:: python

   # core/settings.py
   ...
   LOGGING = {
       "version": 1,
       "disable_existing_loggers": False,
       "handlers": {
           "file": {
               "level": "DEBUG",
               "class": "logging.FileHandler",
               "filename": "sql_queries.log",
           },
       },
       "loggers": {
           "django.db.backends": {
               "level": "DEBUG",
               "handlers": ["file"],
           },
       },
   }

This setup logs all SQL queries executed by Django into a file named ``sql_queries.log`` located in the root directory of your project. 
Each log entry includes the SQL query, the execution time, and additional details about the query.


Exposing the Logs via an API
----------------------------

Once the logs are captured in a file, the next step is to expose them through an API so that monitoring tools like Grafana can access and visualize them. 
We can create a simple Django view to read and parse the log file, returning the results in a structured format like JSON.

**Create a View to Expose the Logs**:

In your ``home/views.py``, create a function-based view that reads the contents of the log file and returns it as JSON. 
This view will parse each log entry to provide useful information such as the query type (SELECT, INSERT, etc.), the execution time, and the full query.

.. code-block:: python

   @api_view(["GET"])
   def get_sql_logs(request):
       log_file = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, "sql_queries.log")
       data = {"total_queries": 0, "total_time": 0, "query_details": []}

       try:
           with open(log_file, "r") as file:
               logs = file.readlines()

           for log in logs:
               match = re.search(LOG_REGEX, log)
               if match:
                   time_taken = float(match.group("time"))
                   query = match.group("query").strip()
                   args = match.group("args").strip()
                   alias = match.group("alias").strip()

                   data["total_queries"] += 1
                   data["total_time"] += time_taken

                   data["query_details"].append(
                       {
                           "time": time_taken,
                           "query": query,
                           "args": args,
                           "alias": alias,
                       }
                   )

           data["average_time"] = (
               data["total_time"] / data["total_queries"]
               if data["total_queries"] > 0
               else 0
           )

           return Response(data)

       except FileNotFoundError:
           return Response({"error": "Log file not found."}, status=404)

The JSON format returned by the API can be easily consumed by monitoring tools like Grafana. 
For example, the API returns metrics such as total query count, average query time, and individual query details. This allows you to visualize important metrics like:

- **Total Queries**: Track the total number of SQL queries over time.
- **Average Query Time**: Monitor the average time taken by SQL queries to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Slow Queries**: Detect and visualize slow queries by filtering logs based on execution time.

Here`s an example JSON response from the API:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "total_queries": 5,
       "total_time": 0.325,
       "average_time": 0.065,
       "logs": [
           {
               "time": 0.045,
               "query": "SELECT * FROM myapp_transaction WHERE id=1",
               "args": "()",
               "alias": "default"
           },
           {
               "time": 0.056,
               "query": "INSERT INTO myapp_transaction (user_id, amount, transaction_type) VALUES (1, 500.00, 'credit')",
               "args": "()",
               "alias": "default"
           }
       ]
   }

**URL Configuration**:

Add the URL for this view in ``home/urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   # home/urls.py

   from django.urls import path
   from . import views
   from transactions.views import TransactionListView as transactions

   urlpatterns = [
       path("", views.index, name="index"),
       path("sql-logs/", views.get_sql_logs, name="sql-logs"), # new url
       path("transactions/", transactions.as_view(), name="transaction-list"),
   ]

Now, you can access the database logs by visiting the endpoint ``http://localhost:8000/sql-logs/``.


Grafana
-------

Grafana is a powerful tool for monitoring, querying, and visualizing data. By integrating it with Django, you can monitor your application`s metrics or visualize data stored in your Django models. 
Let's start by installing the tool.

Download and install Grafana for your operating system. You can find the latest version `here <https://grafana.com/get>`__. After installing, start the Grafana service. For Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl start grafana-server
   sudo systemctl enable grafana-server

For macOS (using Homebrew):

.. code-block:: bash

   brew services start grafana

Open Grafana by going to ``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser. Use the default username and password (admin/admin) to log in. 
Change the password when prompted. We will add a JSON data source that Grafana will listen to for logging the SQL requests and their time.


Add Infinity Data Source
------------------------

1. In Grafana, go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources**.

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729798889132/da821dc5-5959-433e-bf09-7b657971c165.png

2. Click on **Add data source** and search for **Infinity**.

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729798914150/c35a5f25-e0c5-4318-ac94-e4849b04ad39.png

3. Select **Infinity** as the data source.

4. Under the **Name** field, give your data source a meaningful name (e.g., ``Django DB Logs``). 
In the **Base URL** field, enter the URL of the API that returns your log data. In this case, that will be ``http://localhost:8000/sql-logs/``.

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729799016094/7d42bda8-f2dc-4f27-ab98-ddc04033253c.png


Query Data from the API
-----------------------

Once the data source is connected, you can create panels in Grafana to visualize the logs.

1. Click **Create** > **Dashboard**.

2. Add a new **Panel** and configure it.

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729799091200/da74039a-d5b5-45ba-b7b2-61184def8ba8.png

3. On the modal presented, select your **Infinity** data source.

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729799129006/8a4db986-e9ec-4cf4-a140-34d50bb539f7.png

4. In the query editor, specify how to retrieve and display the data. You can choose between the following options:

   - **Source**: JSON URL.
   - **Format**: Choose a **Bar Chart** so we can monitor to examine pics.
   - **URL**: The same API URL (``http://localhost:8000/sql-logs/``).

   .. image:: https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1729799472250/ff007b2b-038a-4691-8917-9f5c2c621920.png

You can now click on **Save dashboard** and enter a title for the dashboard and a description if possible. We have now a view of the SQL query logs.
