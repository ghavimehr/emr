`NestJS <../nestjs/index.html>`__
---------------------------------

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

**Features**

- **Architecture**: Based on TypeScript and heavily inspired by Angular.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrates with other libraries.
- **Modularity**: Encourages modular development with decorators.
- **Support for GraphQL**: Built-in support for GraphQL and WebSockets.

**Use Cases**

- Enterprise applications requiring robust structure.
- Applications needing extensive scalability and testability.

**Getting Started**

To install NestJS and start a new project, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
    nest new project-name

**Basic Server Example**

Create a controller (e.g. `src/app.controller.ts`) in your src folder to handle HTTP requests.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

    @Controller()
    export class AppController {
        @Get()
        getHello(): string {
            return 'Hello from NestJS!';
        }
    }

Then update the main module (`src/app.module.ts`) to include this controller.

.. code-block:: typescript

    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
    import { AppController } from './app.controller';

    @Module({
        imports: [],
        controllers: [AppController],
        providers: [],
    })
    export class AppModule {}

Finally, start the server.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm run start

Now, visit http://localhost:3000 to see the message "Hello from NestJS!"
