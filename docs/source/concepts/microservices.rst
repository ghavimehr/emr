Microservices architecture is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small, independently deployable services. 
Each service runs in its own process and communicates with lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP-based APIs. 
This architecture enhances modularity, allows for independent scaling of application components, and facilitates continuous deployment and technology diversity.
