Metaprogramming is the practice of writing code that generates, manipulates, or analyzes other code. 
It involves techniques that treat programs as data, allowing for dynamic code generation, reflection, and program transformation at runtime or compile-time. 
Metaprogramming can enhance code reusability, create domain-specific languages, and implement complex design patterns efficiently.
