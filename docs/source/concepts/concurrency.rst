    :description: Concurrency refers to the ability of different parts of a program to be executed and Parallelism involves the simultaneous execution

Concurrency refers to the ability of different parts of a program to be executed out-of-order or in partial order without affecting the final outcome. 
Parallelism involves the simultaneous execution of multiple program parts. These concepts are crucial for improving performance in multi-core processors and distributed systems. 
Key topics include threading, locks, semaphores, and parallel algorithms.
