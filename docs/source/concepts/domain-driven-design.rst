Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain. 
It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems. 
DDD includes concepts like bounded contexts, entities, value objects, and aggregates.
