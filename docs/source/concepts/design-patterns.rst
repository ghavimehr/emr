Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for solving issues that occur repeatedly in software development. 
Categories include creational patterns (like Singleton, Factory), structural patterns (like Adapter, Decorator), and behavioral patterns (like Observer, Strategy). 
Understanding design patterns helps in creating more flexible, reusable, and maintainable software architectures.
