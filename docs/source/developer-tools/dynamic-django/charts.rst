This page explains how to use the **Dynamic Charts** feature of `Dynamic Django <./index.html>`__ that allows to showcase different chart types for any model without coding. 

.. include::  /_templates/components/banner-top.rst

Configuration 
-------------

Extracting reports from a source can be a challenging task and Dynamic Charts module aims to solve this task in an easy way.
In order to activate the reports extraction, the model needs to be added in settings. 

The section is a list of rules saved in a dictionary where the key is the path where the **Dynamic Chart** feature is provided and the value is the import path of the model.  

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: core/settings.py  

    # Syntax: URI -> Import_PATH
    DYNAMIC_CHARTS = {
        "product": "home.models.Product",
        "sales": "home.models.Sales",
    }  

How it works 
------------

The information is extracted and later showcased using a chart template where the user can edit a few properties like:

* **Chart Type**: almost every popular type is supported: LINE, BAR, DONUT, RADAR .. etc 
* **X-Axis** column 
* **Y-Axis** column 
* Other column requsted by that speficic chart type 
* Each property can be preprocessed via filter like date-processor, uppercase .. etc 

In the end, the `chart template` is applied on the model data and the charts displayed to the users using real data. 

UI Sections 
------------

All models registered in "settings.DYNAMIC_CHARTS" are shown in the home page of `charts <https://dynamic-django.onrender.com/dynamic-charts/>`__ section:

When a model is selected, we can see all defined templates and also we can inspect the information on page or the embedded format, that can be integrated in external services. 

- Top section exposes three TABS
    - DataTable for data saved in the model 
    - Add Item can be used to add a new item on the model 
    - Add Chart: define a new chart 
- 2nd Section
    - Table with all the charts defined for the current model
